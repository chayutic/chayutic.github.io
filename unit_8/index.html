					<h4>Samsung Career Discovery</h4>
					<h5>UI Design for Samsung's award-winning career counseling web application for students in Thailand.</h5>

				<img class="article_cover_image" src="images/scd_screenshot.png" alt="SCD Screenshot">
				<p>I was contacted to redesign the web app's UI late into the development process and just three months before its launch. The client requested that the visual design avoided suggesting that one's aptitudes will determine one's career path. Since its launch in March of 2016, the web app has won an award from the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority and is projected to be used by over a million users on its first anniversary.<br>

					<h4>"Shards" - Original Radio Drama</h4>
					<h5>A speculative fiction audio narrative where I wrote, directed voice talent, and designed soundscapes.</h5>

				<p>Shards is a speculative science fiction audio narrative that I wrote and produced for a course called Radio Storytelling. The story and music are both original compositions. The cast for the project included my friends and a number of voice actors who contributed remotely, including the female AI's voice. After the script was finished, the recording and post-production took approximately two weeks to complete.</p>

					<h4>"Ephemerality" - Original Song</h4>
					<h5>A song I composed, performed, and engineered as a student at SAE Institute.</h5>
				</div>
				<iframe width="100%" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/46964191&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
				<p>This song was my submission for a studio recording assignment during my time at SAE Institute in 2011. I wrote the song and recorded myself playing each of the three instruments. Recording, mixing, and mastering took roughly two weeks to finish. The track was recorded on an analog console and processed using a mix of both analog outboard gear and digital plugins in Pro Tools</p>
